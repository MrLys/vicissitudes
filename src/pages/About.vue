    Rutta is a work in progress SPA I made mainly for educational purposes.
    It is a free and extremely simple habit tracker. The frontend is made in Gridsome and the backend in Clojure. 
    It's open source, so feel free to create PRs if there is any features
    you're missing. The frontend can be found <a
    href="https://www.github.com/mrlys/vicissitudes.git">here</a> and the
    backend <a
    href="https://www.github.com/mrlys/groove-api.git">here</a>. It will
    probably me merged back into a monorepo soon.
