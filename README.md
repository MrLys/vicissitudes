# Groove - The habit tracker
Groove is a very simple habit tracker. You can create your own habits and each day you can
check the habit of as success (✅), failure (❌) or pass (⚪️).


This is a personal project, and is mostly for educational purposes. And what a journey it has been!


## What is it?
I decided to make this because I've been eager to create something using
Clojure. While considering this, I stumbled upon TailwindCSS and thought that it would potentially
make my life easier regarding frontend development. As a result, the stack ended up being this weird
combination of technologies. I'm using postgreSQL as the database, Clojure in the backend, Grindsome
and Vue using TailwindCSS on top. To ensure https an nginx reverse proxy will probably be used.
